iRecipe application which uses https://themealdb.com/api.php. 

Design and implement a recipe app that provides a database of recipes using the MealDB API.
The app should have the following features:
1.    The first tab should contain a search bar that allows the user to search for a specific recipe by name. If the recipe is found, the app should display its details. If nothing is found, the app should display a message indicating that no recipe was found.
2.    The first tab should also have a list of categories that, when tapped, should push a new screen with recipes of that category. In the same way, when accessing a recipe, the details of the recioe stouc ve cisolaveo
3.    The second tab should display a random recipe each time the user taps on the tab button.

5.    The app should display as many recipe details as possible when a recipe is opened, it's up to vouwarvou snow to me user
UI:
The UI should be simple and intuitive, with a clean and modern design. The search section should be prominently displayed on the first tab, with the section list of categories below it. The second tab requests a random recipe each time it is tapped. The saved recipes should be displayed in a list with the option to delete them and on tap to show the recipe details.

API:
For the API, use the MealDB API provided at https://www.themealdb.com/api.php. Use the API to search for recipes by name, category, and to generate random recipes. Use the API to retrieve recipe details, including ingredients, instructions, and images.
